This web application can be used to predict the mileage of a car that the user 
is planning to buy or is using. The inputs needed for prediction are 
1) Number of cylinders
2) Engine size
3) Car Weight
4) Horse Power

The prediction is based on the observations from the mtcars dataset available 
in the base R package. It uses the data from mtcars and fits a linear model to
the mileage as a function of the input variables presented above.

It generates two ouputs. First one is a paired plot to give an overview of how
the mileage varies as a function of the variables in the training dataset for 
the model. The second output is a prediction of the mileage for the input 
variables along with a 95% confidence interval for the prediction.
